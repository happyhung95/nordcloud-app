```
Problem solving
Write a program that solves the most suitable (with most power) link station for a device at given point [x,y].
Please make this project as complete as you think it should be to be maintainable in the long term by more than one maintainer. ​Provide instructions how to run the solution or if applicable how to access a deployed running version.
This problem can be solved in 2-dimensional space. Link stations have reach and power.
A link station’s power can be calculated:
power = (reach - device's distance from linkstation)^2
if distance > reach, power = 0
Program should output following line:
“Best link station for point x,y is x,y with power z”
or:
“No link station within reach for point x,y”
Link stations​ are located at points ​(x, y)​ and have reach ​(r) ([x, y, r])​: 
[[0, 0, 10],
[20, 20, 5],
[10, 0, 12]]
Print out function output from ​points​ ​(x, y): (0,0), (100, 100), (15,10)​ and ​(18, 18)
```
